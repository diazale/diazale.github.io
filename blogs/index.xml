      <description>&lt;p&gt;From April 2022 to September 2023, I collected news stories of car crashes in Canada.&#xA;Specifically, crashes where the drivers struck something or someone &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than another vehicle.&#xA;The rules were simple:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There was a motor vehicle involved; and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The vehicle struck either a structure or a person who was not in a vehicle&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of why I constrained my data was to understand how much damage cars and their drivers were causing to people who were not themselves driving.&#xA;Another part was that there is simply &lt;em&gt;so much traffic violence&lt;/em&gt; that I would not be able to track it on my own&amp;mdash;for damage to structures, I had to exclude things like hydro poles and traffic lights because it would be overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
